### Project Overview

- BurgerBash SQL Case study:Tables include Customer Orders, Runner Orders, Burger Runner, and Burger Name.
- The project ensures smooth order processing and delivery tracking. Check out the SQL scripts for a comprehensive understanding of the data structure. Explore the world of burger order analysis through this practical project on GitHub.

### Data Source 

- The data for this project originates from a custom schema designed for the BurgerBash SQL case study.
- It consists of tables such as Customer Orders, Runner Orders, Burger Runner, and Burger Name. These tables provide a structured format for organizing information related to burger orders. 
- The project's database is independently created, focusing on practical SQL. Refer to the GitHub repository for detailed insights into how these tables manage and structure data 
in the context of the BurgerBash case study.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

1. How many burgers were ordered?
2. How many unique customer orders were made?
3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
4. How many of each type of burger was delivered?
5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
6. What was the maximum number of burgers delivered in a single order?
7. For each customer, how many delivered burgers had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
8. What was the total volume of burgers ordered for each hour of the day?
9. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period?
10. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

### Recommendations

Optimize Runner Assignments:
- Consider a balanced distribution of orders among runners to ensure fair workload and efficient deliveries.

Enhance Burger Variety:
- Introduce new burger options to cater to diverse customer preferences, potentially boosting overall order volume.

Streamline Order Changes:
- Implement a clear system for customers to modify orders, reducing the likelihood of errors and enhancing customer satisfaction.

Implement Hourly Promotions:
- Introduce time-specific promotions to encourage orders during slower periods and better distribute order volume throughout the day.

Expand Runner Pool:
- Encourage more runners to sign up, ensuring a reliable and scalable delivery network, especially during peak hours.

Monitor Distance Metrics:
-Regularly assess delivery distances to identify opportunities for optimizing routes and potentially reducing overall delivery times.

These recommendations aim to improve the efficiency and customer experience within the BurgerBash system.

### Limitations

Data Accuracy:
- The results depend on how accurate the information we got is. Mistakes or missing details might make the findings less reliable.

Runner Availability:
- We assume there are always enough runners. If the number of runners changes, it could affect how quickly orders get delivered.

Simplified Customer Preferences:
- Sorting customers into just Vegetarian and Meatlovers might be too simple. People's food choices are often more varied.

Limited Burger Options:
- We only looked at a small number of burger choices. Including more options would give us a better idea of what people like.

External Influences:
- We didn't think about things like bad weather or special events that might change how many orders we get. These things can affect our findings.
